	     	<h1>Hello, welcome to my page!</h1> 
			<h2> Today, I'm going to talk about one of my hobbies, <strong>Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS)</strong></h2>
	        <p>In DFS, players compete with each other with teams constructed with a combination of players that area assigned a salary. There's a limit to how much you can spend on the players you choose, called a <em>salary cap.</em></p>
			
			<p><a href="draftshot.com"> Draft shot </a> Is a website about DFS that I often go to. Most of the  elements I used in this page were used in this website. I love the layout but some code isn't familiar because of the cms that's being used on the backend </p>

			<h3>Reasons why I play:</h3>
			<ul>
			    <li>Gives me another reason to watch sports</li>
			    <li>Keeps me connected with friends from my hometown</li>
			    <li>Large community of players</li>
			</ul>
